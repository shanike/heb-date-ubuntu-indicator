1. Create an executable file called `heb_date_indicator`
    ```bash
    touch heb_date_indicator 
    chmod -x heb_date_indicator
    ```
2. Inside it:
    ```bash
    vim heb_date_indicator
    python3 /home/...absolute-path-to.../heb_date_indicator.py
    ```
3. Search for "Startup Applications" in your applications menu
4. Add a program:
    - <span style="text-decoration: underline">Name:</span> heb date indicator (or whatever you'd like)
    - **<span style="text-decoration: underline">File:</span> path to your executable file from step 1**
    - <span style="text-decoration: underline">Comment:</span> whatever you want
5. Done. 
    
After rebooting, you should see the hebrew date at the top of your screen (next to the wifi settings and the current language indicators)
